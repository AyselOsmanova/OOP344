• the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from 
  your code

  The main difference is keywords, I used "static" for internal and "extern"
  for external linkages.
    
I use a local variable to store the current item number and starts with the 
value of an external global variable named INITIAL defined in another translation unit.
 

• the execution effect of the code in the process() function that creates the String 
  object which is inserted into standard output (which member function(s) 
  does this code call)

 Overloaded operator '<<' defined in
 String.cpp that insert the member data 'string' into the ostream output.



• the changes that you made in upgrading your String class.

I used dynamically allocation in String.cpp " astring = new char[sizeof(other_string)]; "
to support the number of characters needed by the passed string into the String class 
constructor
