•	The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.

        I t is easier way to sort data in a contiguous set of memory.Moreover,
        vector does not need initial declaration.
        


•	List the STL template functions that you used in your solution.

          pair<T,T> sumOf_a_b() const:
          accumulate()
          T median() const:
          sort()
          T sigma() const:
          for_each()
          

•	Identify where you used lambda expressions.
           pair<T,T> sumOf_a_b() const:
           T sigma() const;
           T slope() const;

•	Comment on the ease of programming associated with the STL.
         STL is the easy way that helps programmer to work with the data coming from container
